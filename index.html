                        This is the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/" target="_blank">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>
                        authored by Forrest Brazeal. It tasks the user with creating and deploying an online CV backed by various 
                        cloud-based technologies. I chose to use AWS and worked with the following technologies:
                    </p>
                    <ul id="AWS-technologies">
                        <li>
                            <p>S3 - for the frontend hosting</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>CloudFront - for efficient content distribution</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Route 53 - for the domain name registration</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Certificate Manager - for securing the site with HTTPS</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>DynamoDB - for storing the web page views</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Lambda - for creating the API between the frontend javascript and the backend database</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Finally, as an introduction to DevOps, I was able to implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)
                        using Github Actions with some pipeline configurations in YAML so that the live site is updated on every push. You can find

                            <p>
                                To advance my knowledge of neural networks I followed Tariq Rashid’s 
                                “Make Your Own Neural Network” and built a digit classifier program. 
                                Rather than using methods provided by Numpy and Scipy, I built the 
                                program from scratch using Java, which allowed me to gain a deeper
                                understanding of how the network worked. A demonstration of the 
                                program can be found <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/nBjKZo18rOg?feature=share" target="_blank">here</a>.
